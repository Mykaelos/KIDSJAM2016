- fix difficulty scaling
- make InputManager.cannons not static
- Make message count change good enough.
- balloonController.pop change bool to something else to make points worth it, or change the method, or dup method
- clean up the end screen

-- explain who made the game (Frankie on design)
- clean up the everyoneLeftTheGame concept, and fix the odd boolean that i have in gameplaystate

- Add in Frankie's Yay!
- Clean up timing on everything.

- add easy debug for testing states, and speeding up gameplay
- properly remove all balloons for each state

- add different balloon sprites
-- add colors for the pop particles

- add clouds floating by, that loop
- add a static sun in the background


- Refactor music to not have to be in the resources folder.
-- Maybe have gamePlay hold a list of songs?
--- maybe have the editor auto collect those songs from a music folder, and save by name
- refactor music to be played like sounds if needed. and have a volumne and pitch passed in if needed.
- For CannonController or others, add AudioSource.PlaySound that takes in pitch and volume and stuff, better than using AudioManager.


- Add Player number or controller to cannon?
- Change color of cannon randomly, or something.
