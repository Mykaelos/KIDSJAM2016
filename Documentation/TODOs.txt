TODOs Fixes
fix balloon collisions

explosion balloon - pink  (one morning)
- custom balloon (make a new one) and color it
- can be spawned specifically, and randomly spawns rarely
- add pops count to end screen

- Add highscore metric?

TODOs New Features
- PROBABLY NOT - Add Player number or controller to cannon?
- Change color of cannon randomly, or something.


- WOULD BE AWESOME to shift the difficulty with the music! (one morning)
-- make more balloons when it gets more intense and louder, then back off when it gets quieter...


TODO Refactoring
- refactor music to be played like sounds if needed. and have a volume and pitch passed in if needed.
- For CannonController or others, add AudioSource.PlaySound that takes in pitch and volume and stuff, better than using AudioManager.
