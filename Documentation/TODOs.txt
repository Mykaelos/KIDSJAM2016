TODOs Fixes


TODOs New Features
- PROBABLY NOT - Add Player number or controller to cannon?
- Change color of cannon randomly, or something.

Change the red balloons to explode only those within a radius, because the whole screen clears seem to make the game less fun.

message generated based on something
- teamwork?
- got all red balloons?
- something else?

TODO Refactoring


WONT FIX/DO
- fix balloon collisions - it's more fun to leave this in here.
- Add highscore metric? - Does it really matter? This game is about collaboration, not competition.
