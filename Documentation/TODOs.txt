TODOs Fixes
- clean up the end screen
-- add better credits, maybe a picture of Frank and Da?
-- explain who made the game (Frankie on design)


TODOs New Features
** add button text to return to title screen on end screen

- Added a Credits screen that's shown first, then start screen.
- can be navigated back to from the start screen somehow...

- Add Player number or controller to cannon?
- Change color of cannon randomly, or something.


- WOULD BE AWESOME to shift the difficulty with the music!
-- make more balloons when it gets more intense and louder, then back off when it gets quieter...


TODO Refactoring
- refactor music to be played like sounds if needed. and have a volumne and pitch passed in if needed.
- For CannonController or others, add AudioSource.PlaySound that takes in pitch and volume and stuff, better than using AudioManager.
